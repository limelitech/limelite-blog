## 🌐 What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building websites and web applications. It is typically divided into three parts:

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) - the structure and content
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) - the styling and layout
- **JavaScript** - interactivity and dynamic content

## 🧰 Tools You Need

Before writing any code, make sure you have the following:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **VS Code** (a free code editor): [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- A modern web browser like Chrome or Firefox
- A **GitHub** account for hosting your website online

## 🗂️ Project Structure

Create a new folder called `my-first-website` and organize it like this:

```
my-first-website/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── script.js
└── images/
    └── your-image.jpg
```

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Build the HTML

Create a file named `index.html` and paste the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>My First Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph introducing the website.</p>
  </header>

  <section class="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m learning how to build websites from scratch.</p>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <p>© 2025 My First Website</p>
  </footer>

  <script src="js/script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

## 🎨 Step 2: Add CSS for Styling

Inside the `css` folder, create `style.css` and add:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  color: #333;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  text-align: center;
}

header {
  background-color: #007acc;
  color: white;
  padding: 40px 0;
}

.about {
  margin: 40px 20px;
}

footer {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 20px 0;
  position: fixed;
  width: 100%;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

---

## ✨ Step 3: Add JavaScript

Inside the `js` folder, create `script.js`:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world! Welcome to my website.");
alert("Welcome to my first website!");
```

JavaScript can handle user interactions, validate forms, load data dynamically, and much more.

## 🚀 Step 4: Host Your Website on GitHub Pages

1. Initialize a Git repository inside your folder:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

2. Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-first-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

3. Go to **Settings > Pages** in the GitHub repository.
4. Under “Source”, select the `main` branch and save.
5. Your site will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/my-first-website/`
